## The login from phone number process

You can choose between two different processes/user experiences

The different steps are described and illustrated with screenshots below.

### 1. Initiate Vipps Login from phone number

The merchant initiates Vipps Login based on phone number from the merchantÂ´s system. The user receives a push from Vipps on the phone. The user clicks the push to open Vipps.

If the user has turned off push or for some other reason do not get push the user can open Vipps themselves and the process to confirm the login will start automatically.

### 2. Confirm in Vipps

After opening Vipps the user will be asked to confirm sharing information with the merchant. The page will specify the information requested by the merchant.

The merchant can choose to show a confirmation code / binding message on the confirmation screen. This is for added security if the merchant would like their representatives or their customers to have an explicit check that it is the correct transaction that is being accepted.

After confirming the login / sharing of information the user will be asked for the formal consent to share information from Vipps to the merchant. This consent is only needed once per merchant and applies across all Vipps services, i.e. if the user has already consented to share the requested information with the merchant no consent will be required.

### 3. Confirmation, possibility to continue process

The merchant controls what happens after the user has  confirmed the login/sharing of information. The merchant can end the process in Vipps giving confirmation of successful completion in Vipps, or the merchant can have the user taken to a page in the browser on the phone. If the user is taken to a page in the browser the merchant has an identified user, can control the information given and ask the user to do further actions to continue the process if relevant. This can e.g. be used to welcome a user to the customer club and ask for more information or consent to marketing. This can also be used to present terms of condition for a subscription/purchase and allow the user to pay with Vipps.
