# Vipps Login API

<!-- START_COMMENT -->

ℹ️ Please use the new documentation:
[Vipps Technical Documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/).

With the Login API, users can login to your service by using their Vipps account.
This simplifies the process for users, as they don't need to fill out a form or remember a password to access your services.
This also provides you with pre-verified user data.
