## Overview
To have a unified way of serving a merchant user information between our applications in Vipps we have implemented a new service handling this responsibility.
Vipps Login will be the first service to integrate with this new endpoint.

## Api changes
* Scope 'nnin' is changed to 'nin'
* Format of claim 'birthdate' is changed from **dd.mm.yyyy** to **yyyy-mm-dd**, to comply with the ISO 8601 format.
* Claim address have been converted from a list of all address to an object of the default address. All other addresses are served under 'other_address' as a list. 
This is done to comply with the OIDC-standard which expect address to be a json object.
* User information is no longer served on the 'id_token'. Therefore, the 'id_token' will only contain user ids. 
This is done since the data in the id token should be used to lookup the authenticated user, while the userinfo endpoint should be used to fetch and store user information.   

## Convert to Vipps Login api version 2.0
To control which response to serve we need the merchant to send inn scope 'api_version_2'.
Once starting to use Vipps Login api version 2.0 if the scope 'nnin' is being requested it has to be converted to 'nin'.
In the new api the claim 'address' is now the preferred address (default) for the Vipps user and no longer a list of all addresses.
This new object will contain the same fields, except for field 'default', which is implied.
The other addresses, if any, of the user are now served under claim 'other_address' as a list.
The format for claim 'birthdate' has been updated from dd.mm.yyyy to yyyy-mm-dd.
See here for an example of the [userinfo response](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-login-api/#/public/userinfo).
If the integration to Vipps Login are using the 'id_token' for fetching user information, then this has to be converted to fetch these from the '/userinfo' endpoint.
