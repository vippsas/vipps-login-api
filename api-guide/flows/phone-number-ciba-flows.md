# Login from a phone number

*Login from phone number* is built to support special cases where login does not start in a browser or app.

*Login from phone number* is based on the
[Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html).

In this flow, the merchant's system triggers the authentication/registration; thus, log-in cannot be done in the user's browser.
To ensure a consistent user experience, *Vipps Login from phone number* is not allowed on webpages and in apps.

A sales unit can use the Login API for many flows.
It is recommended to use the same sales unit for all use cases to ensure that you get the same user ID (`sub`) on the user across different scenarios.

*Login from phone number* is initiated using the user's mobile number. This triggers a push message from the user's Vipps app. By clicking the push message, the user is taken to Vipps to confirm the authentication/registration. If the user has not already consented to share information with a merchant, such consent will be required. If the user has not enabled push from Vipps, they need to manually open the Vipps app and possibly pull the home screen down for a refresh to receive the authentication request.

The merchant controls whether the user should get the confirmation of completion in the Vipps app or if they should be taken to the merchant's web page to finalize the flow.
For example, the merchant can take the user to their web page to enable input of more information, accept terms and conditions, log the user in at their web page, show relevant information/offers or to continue to set up an agreement or completing a purchase. This is illustrated in [How Login works from phone number](../../how-it-works/vipps-login-from-phone-number-api-howitworks.md).

Illustration of how the flow will look when the user ends the flow and gets the confirmation of completion in the Vipps app:

![Confirm completion in Vipps app](../../images/CIBA_flow_in_app.png)

Illustration of how the flow will look if the user is taken to the merchant's web page:

![Redirect to browser](../../images/CIBA_flow_take_to_merchant.png)

The merchant has the option to show a confirmation code (`binding_message`) to the user in the app for added security:

## Complete login in the Vipps app

### Overview

Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user through out-of-band mechanisms.

1. The Client shall make an "HTTP POST" request to the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint to ask for end-user authentication.
2. Vipps Login will respond immediately with a unique identifier that identifies that authentication while it tries to authenticate the user in the background.
3. The Client will receive the ID Token and Access Token by polling the token endpoint to get a response with the tokens.

### Call by call

0. Before all this, the merchant has fetched the OpenID configuration from the well-known endpoint and cached it.
   See [.well-known](../integration.md#openid-connect-discovery-endpoint)

1. The merchant initiates a login by calling the `backchannel_authentication_endpoint` listed in the OpenID configuration fetched in step 0.

   For details see [Authentication Request](#authentication-request).

   Example request:

    ```http
    POST https://api.vipps.no/vipps-login-ciba/api/backchannel/authentication
    Authorization: Basic asdkjhasdjhsad=
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    scope=name address openid&login_hint=urn:mobilenumber:{mobileNumber}&state=13821s837213bng26e2n61gege26&nonce=21hebdhwqdb7261bd1b23
    ```

   Example response:

    ```http
    200 application/json
    {
      "auth_req_id": "VYGaaAMRkI6SyAm_uIywhxsN2K0",
      "expires_in": 600,
      "interval": 5
    }
    ```

2. The merchant starts polling the `token` endpoint listed in the OpenID configuration fetched in step 0.

   Polling in this context means doing repeated HTTP requests with a delay between them.

   [Information about polling](#polling). Note that the polling interval should adhere to the `interval` response parameter (in seconds) returned in step 1.

   For other details about the request, see [Token request](#token-request).

   Example request:

    ```http
    POST https://api.vipps.no/access-management-1.0/access/oauth2/token
    Authorization: Basic asdkjhasdjhsad=
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=urn%3Aopenid%3Aparams%3Agrant-type%3Aciba&auth_req_id=VYGaaAMRkI6SyAm_uIywhxsN2K0
    ```

   Example pending response (Other possible error responses can be found in the [CIBA standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.11)):

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    {
      "error": "authorization_pending",
      "error_description": "The authorization request is still pending"
    }
    ```

   The merchant should keep polling when it receives `authorization_pending` in the error response. After the user completes the login in the app, the `token` endpoint will give a successful response similar to the following example:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {
      "access_token": "ciba.W_IfBcSr-askdjhsakjhd",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 300,
      "id_token": "eyaksjdhksajhdjkashdjksadjnn91283hedhn.eyasdkjhaskjdhskajhdkjhasdkjhaskjhdwqiuh"
    }
    ```

3. The merchant must do a GET to the `userinfo` endpoint with the header: Authorization: Bearer {access_token}, using the access_token retrieved in step 2.

   For details see [Userinfo request](../integration.md#userinfo).

   Example request:

    ```http
    GET https://api.vipps.no/vipps-userinfo-api/userinfo
    Authorization: Bearer ciba.W_IfBcSr-askdjhsakjhd
    ```

   Example response:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    {
      "address": {
        "address_type": "home",
        "country": "NO",
        "formatted": "jghj khhjhhkjh\n0603\nOSLO\nNO",
        "postal_code": "0603",
        "region": "OSLO",
        "street_address": "jghj khhjhhkjh"
      },
      "family_name": "Heyerdahl",
      "given_name": "Tor Fos",
      "name": "Tor Fos Heyerdahl",
      "other_addresses": [],
      "sid": "qwieuhwqiuhdiuwqh",

    }
    ```

### Authentication Request

Standard definition: <https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_request>

The Backchannel Authentication Endpoint is listed as `backchannel_authentication_endpoint` in the configuration <https://api.vipps.no/access-management-1.0/access/.well-known/openid-configuration>.

#### Authentication

The following authentication methods are currently supported:

* client_secret_basic
* client_secret_post

The default token endpoint authentication method is `client_secret_basic`. It is possible to change the authentication method to `client_secret_post` in the Vipps portal. [More information in the FAQ](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/login-api/vipps-login-api-faq.md#how-can-i-use-client_secret_post-for-authentication).

#### The `login_hint` parameter (required)

Supported login hints:

* Norwegian mobile phone numbers can be targeted by passing login hint's on the format `urn:mobilenumber:{8 digit norwegian mobile number}`.

Example: `...&login_hint=urn:mobilenumber:12345678&...`.

#### The `scope` parameter (required)

* We support the scopes listed at [Scopes](../core-concepts.md#scopes)
* The legacy `nnin` scope is not supported, use `nin` instead.

Example: `...&scope=name address birthDate nin&...`

#### The `binding_message` parameter (optional)

A human-readable identifier or message intended to be displayed on both the consumption device and the authentication device to interlock them together for the transaction by way of a visual cue for the end-user. It should not be used for attempting to conveying other information.

#### Format

The format possible for this field is limited to capital characters 'A-Z', numbers '0-9' and the character '-'. It must also be between 5 and 8 characters long. Regex: ```^[A-Z0-9\\-]{5,8}$```.

Read more about it in the standard <https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_request>.

Example: `....&binding_message=4MZ-CQ3&...`

#### Successful responses

Standard definition: <https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#successful_authentication_request_acknowdlegment>

Responses according to the standard. Note, we do return an `interval` parameter which indicates the minimum amount of time in seconds that the Client MUST wait between polling requests to the token endpoint.

### Token request

Standard definition: <https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.10.1>

The responses from this endpoint is according to the standard.

* Note the required `grant_type`: `urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba`.
* The access token can be used towards the standard [OIDC userinfo endpoint](../integration.md#userinfo).

#### Polling

* Long polling as described in [the CIBA standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#token_request) is currently not supported
* Remember not to poll more often than indicated by the `interval` parameter, returned from the [authentication request](#authentication-request).

### Error responses

In addition to the responses defined by the [standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.11) these responses might be returned:

* `429` status responses: Too many login requests started towards the same user at the same time. Please respect the `Retry-After` header returned.
* `error_code=old_app`: The user's Vipps app is outdated and does not support this login flow.
* `error_code=invalid_user`: No account exists, the user's account is not active, or the user is in some way not eligible to use this login flow currently e.g. U15 users.

## Redirect to browser

### Overview

This CIBA-related flow enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user through out-of-band mechanisms and additionally facilitates the end user
to be taken to the client's web page to finalize the flow.

1. The Client shall make an "HTTP POST" request to the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint to ask for end-user authentication.
2. The user, via their browser, will be redirected to the Client's `redirect_uri` which enables the login to be completed.

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Merchant
    participant VippsLogin as Vipps Login
    participant VippsApp as Vipps app
    participant Browser
    actor User

    Merchant ->> VippsLogin: POST /authentication-request (scope, login_hint, redirect_uri...)
    User ->> VippsApp: Confirm login
    VippsApp ->> Browser: Opens browser
    Browser ->> Merchant: `redirect_uri`
    Merchant ->> VippsLogin: POST /oauth2/token
    Merchant ->> VippsLogin: GET /userinfo
```

### Call by call

0. Before all this, the merchant has fetched the OpenID configuration from the well-known endpoint and cached it.
   See [.well-known](../integration.md#openid-connect-discovery-endpoint).

1. The merchant initiates a login by calling the `backchannel_authentication_endpoint` listed in the OpenID configuration fetched in step 0.

   For details see [Authentication Request With Redirect](#authentication-request-with-redirect).

   Example request (the real payload will likely look different because of encoding):

    ```http
    POST https://api.vipps.no/vipps-login-ciba/api/backchannel/authentication
    Authorization: Basic asdkjhasdjhsad=
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    requested_flow=login_to_webpage&scope=openid name address&login_hint=urn:mobilenumber:{mobileNumber}&redirect_uri=https://merchantwebpage.com/callback
    ```

   Example response, the `auth_req_id` should be used to connect this login to a token response since the ID token should contain the same `auth_req_id` value.

    ```http
    200 application/json
    {
      "auth_req_id": "VYGaaAMRkI6SyAm_uIywhxsN2K0",
      "expires_in": 600,
      "interval": 5
    }
    ```

2. The user confirms the login and is then redirected to the `redirect_uri` passed in the initial request 1. The redirect will contain a `code`: `{redirect_uri}?code={code}`.

3. The merchant uses the code-parameter to obtain the login token. Perform a POST request towards the `{token_endpoint}` with `code={code}`, `grant_type=urn:vipps:params:grant-type:ciba-redirect` in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded-body`.
   This returns an ID token and an access token that can be used to fetch userinfo.
   The ID token is a JWS that must be validated, see [ID Token](../core-concepts.md#id-token). The merchant **must validate** that it contains the `auth_req_id` they have previously received from step 2.

   Example request (the real payload will likely look different because of encoding):

    ```http
    POST https://api.vipps.no/access-management-1.0/access/oauth2/token
    Authorization: Basic sadlksadkjasjdaksd
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

## Merchants delegated consents

### Activation

See [How can I get started with delegatedConsents?](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/login-api/vipps-login-api-faq.md#how-can-i-get-started-with-delegatedconsents).

### Overview

For Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) it is possible to initiate the authentication of an end-user through out-of-band mechanisms and collect consents on behalf of the merchant.

1) The Client shall make an "HTTP POST" request to the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint with scope `delegatedConsents` to ask for end-user authentication and on behalf of the merchant consents.
2) Vipps Login will respond immediately with a unique identifier that identifies that authentication while it tries to authenticate the user in the background, along with collecting consents.
3) The Client will receive the ID Token and Access Token by polling the token endpoint to get a response with the tokens.
4) Token can be used by the Client to retrieve information about the user through the `userinfo` endpoint, this response will also contain the consents that are approved/declined by the user.

Requesting on behalf consents for merchant is also available for [Vipps login from phone number with redirect to browser](#redirect-to-browser), by adding scope delegatedConsents to the initial request (1).
