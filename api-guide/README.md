Vipps Login is the easiest way to sign in and create an account in both digital and physical settings. No typing required! Users don’t need to worry about forgetting or loosing their usernames and passwords. All they need to remember is their phone number. Vipps Login is easier for the user while you as a merchant get better conversion and data quality.

The following topics are described:

- [Overview](overview.md) high level description of the flows our APIs facilitate
- [Important information](important-information.md)
- [Core concepts](core-concepts.md) explains some relevant OIDC concepts and parameters
- [Browser flow integration](integration.md) how to implement the browser flow
- Special flows
    - [App integration](flows/app-integration.md)
    - [Automatic return from Vipps app](flows/automatic-return.md) reducing required user interaction when appropriate
    - [Vipps login from phone number](flows/phone-number-ciba-flows.md) direct login in the Vipps app
    - [No dialog flow](flows/no-dialog.md) check if a user is already logged in
- [Partner keys](partner-keys.md) integration for partners

**Please note:** The information fetched from the Report API is
asynchronous and trailing behind the other APIs. It is usually behind
by a second or so, but if there are operational problems, it could, in the worst
case, be behind by several hours. Therefore, you should always use other
Vipps APIs as the source of truth for the status of an operation.
